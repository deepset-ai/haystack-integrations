# Haystack Integrations

This repository is an index of Haystack integrations that can be used with a Haystack Pipeline or Agent.

These integrations are maintained by their respective owner or authors. You can browse them on the [Haystack Integrations](https://haystack.deepset.ai/integrations) page, where you will find information on the Author(s), installation and usage of each tool.

## What are Haystack Integrations?

Haystack Integrations are a Document Store, Model Provider, Custom Component, Monitoring Tool or Evaluation Framework that are either external packages or additional technologies that can be used with Haystack. Some integrations may be maintained by the deepset team, others are community contributions owned by the authors of the integration. Read more about Haystack Integrations in [Introduction to Integrations](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/v2.0/docs/integrations).
