# OpenLLMetry

OpenLLMetry is an open-source Python package built and maintained by Traceloop that instruments your Haystack-based applications with OpenTelemetry. This gives you full visibility to your LLM app, right in your existing observability stack. You can also connect this to Traceloop to get quality evaluation metrics and LLM-specific capabilities like Prompt Playground.

More info on the [documentation](https://traceloop.com/docs/python-sdk).

## Installation

```
pip install traceloop-sdk
```

## Example

Basic integration is as simple as adding one line to your code:

```python
Traceloop.init(app_name="your_app_name")
```

When you run your code, you'll get a link to the Traceloop UI where you can see your app's traces.
If you want to connect to a different observability platform, [follow the guide for exporting your traces](https://traceloop.com/docs/python-sdk/exporting).

### Use a Traceloop API Key

If you have an account with Traceloop and would like to see your traces on your account dashboard:

- Create an API key on Traceloop
- Export the API key in an environment variable called `TRACELOOP_API_KEY`

### Trace Haystack Pipelines

Once you've initialized a Traceloop app, any Haystack pipeline that you run in the same environment will get logged in the dashboard provided by the generated Traceloop URL.
For example, below is a simple Haystack pipeline and its traceloop logs:

```python
from haystack.nodes import PromptNode, PromptTemplate, AnswerParser
from haystack.pipelines import Pipeline
from traceloop.sdk import Traceloop

Traceloop.init(app_name="haystack_app")

prompt = PromptTemplate(
    prompt="Tell me a joke about {query}\n",
    output_parser=AnswerParser(),
)

prompt_node = PromptNode(
    model_name_or_path="gpt-4",
    api_key=api_key,
    default_prompt_template=prompt,
)

pipeline = Pipeline()
pipeline.add_node(component=prompt_node, name="PromptNode", inputs=["Query"])
result = pipeline.run("Haystack")
```
